# moduleFourChallenge

For this weeks challenge I'm working more in depth with Javascript  and finding other ways to efficiently write effective code.

Using logic based coding, I'm hoping to not only create a quiz program that uses a multiple choice algorithm. I'm also hoping to make a working quiz that I can use for my own personal reasons.
